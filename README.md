# ArtPart
ArtPart is an app that incentivises people to donate to charity while at the same time increasing children's motivation to make art. The idea was to create an app where kids could make art and sell it on our app. From there, prospective buyers could look at given pieces of art and buy it (all money goes to charity). From there, we notify users when the art has been bought.

## Reviewer Guide
After you've extracted the zip file, double click on the _.xcworkspace_ file. This project uses CocoaPods and all of the dependencies are already in the zip. Once inside XCode, click the run button or hit _command + r_ to build and run. 

**It is best to run this project on a real device**, because you need it for taking a picture with the camera (since the simulator doesn't have a camera). Not allowing the `photoAlbum` sourcetype was an intentional design decision because otherwise it would be very easy for the user to upload art that is not theirs.. etc.
